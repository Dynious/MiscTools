Companion model creation guide:

The standard block created in Blender represents a Minecraft block.
The companion model should be max two blocks high and one block deep
and wide.

Save your model as YOURMODELNAME.obj and make sure you select triangulate
faces when you export it to .obj in Blender.

Now make a file named YOURMODELNAME.properties.

In this file create this line:
modelOffsetY:number

'number' Is how much the model needs to go up or down to be exactly on the 
floor. The distance is measured in standard Blender blocks. The claptrap
model is 1 Standard Blender Blocks under the floor so 'number' is
1.0F for the claptrap model.


Now create this line:
armOffsetY:number

'number' Is the distance between the 'floor' of your model
and the point it sould rotate from in float. The distance is measured 
in standard Blender blocks. The arms of the Claptrap model are 0.6
Standard Blender Block from the rotationpoint. So 'number' for the
Claptrap model is 0.6F

Now create another line:
hasWheel:true/false(:number)

If your model has a weel (or multiple) make this true and put a colon(:)
and after that the distance from the rotationpoint in float, measured
again in Standard Blender Blocks. If false just put false without something
after it.

Now create one more line:
hasLegs:true/false(:number)

If your model has legs (or multiple) make this true and put a colon(:)
and after that the distance from the rotationpoint in float, measured
again in Standard Blender Blocks. If false just put false without something
after it.
